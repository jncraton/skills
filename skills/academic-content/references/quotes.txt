Meta	While pre-training our Llama 4 Behemoth model using FP8 and 32K GPUs, we achieved 390 TFLOPs/GPU. The overall data mixture for training consisted of more than 30 trillion tokens.	https://ai.meta.com/blog/llama-4-multimodal-intelligence/
T5 Paper	Our systematic study compares pre-training objectives, architectures, unlabeled data sets, transfer approaches, and other factors on dozens of language understanding tasks.

InstructGPT Paper	we show an avenue for aligning language models with user intent on a wide range of tasks by fine-tuning with human feedback. Starting with a set of labeler-written prompts and prompts submitted through the OpenAI API, we collect a dataset of labeler demonstrations of the desired model behavior, which we use to fine-tune GPT-3 using supervised learning. We then collect a dataset of rankings of model outputs, which we use to further fine-tune this supervised model using reinforcement learning from human feedback. We call the resulting models InstructGPT. In human evaluations on our prompt distribution, outputs from the 1.3B parameter InstructGPT model are preferred to outputs from the 175B GPT-3, despite having 100x fewer parameters.	https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02155
Flan-T5 Paper	We find that instruction finetuning with the above aspects dramatically improves performance on a variety of model classes (PaLM, T5, U-PaLM), prompting setups (zero-shot, few-shot, CoT), and evaluation benchmarks (MMLU, BBH, TyDiQA, MGSM, open-ended generation). [...] Overall, instruction finetuning is a general method for improving the performance and usability of pretrained language models.	https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11416

DeepSeek-V3 Paper	To achieve efficient inference and cost-effective training, DeepSeek-V3 adopts Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) and DeepSeekMoE architectures, which were thoroughly validated in DeepSeek-V2. Furthermore, DeepSeek-V3 pioneers an auxiliary-loss-free strategy for load balancing and sets a multi-token prediction training objective for stronger performance. We pre-train DeepSeek-V3 on 14.8 trillion diverse and high-quality tokens, followed by Supervised Fine-Tuning and Reinforcement Learning stages to fully harness its capabilities. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that DeepSeek-V3 outperforms other open-source models and achieves performance comparable to leading closed-source models.	https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19437
DeepSeek-R1 Paper	Here we show that the reasoning abilities of LLMs can be incentivized through pure reinforcement learning (RL), obviating the need for human-labeled reasoning trajectories. The proposed RL framework facilitates the emergent development of advanced reasoning patterns, such as self-reflection, verification, and dynamic strategy adaptation. Consequently, the trained model achieves superior performance on verifiable tasks such as mathematics, coding competitions, and STEM fields, surpassing its counterparts trained via conventional supervised learning on human demonstrations.	https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12948
Lira et al.	Contrary to predictions by lay forecasters, participants randomly assigned to practice writing with access to an AI tool improved more on a writing test one day later compared to writers assigned to practice without AI—despite exerting less effort. Likewise, whereas forecasters predicted that AI would be less helpful, and less worth paying for, than personalized feedback from experienced human editors, we found the converse: practicing with AI increased skill more than feedback from human editors (or simply googling examples and tips). The results of a third experiment suggest that AI may teach by example: writers merely shown an AI-generated cover letter (without the opportunity to practice) performed as well as writers who practiced writing with the original AI tool. Collectively, the findings of these pre-registered studies constitute an existence proof that by providing personalized, high-quality examples, AI can improve, rather than undermine, learning.	https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02880

How AI Impacts Skill Formation	Novice workers who rely heavily on AI to complete unfamiliar tasks may compromise their own skill acquisition in the process. We conduct randomized experiments to study how developers gained mastery of a new asynchronous programming library with and without the assistance of AI.

Simon Willison	Skills are conceptually extremely simple: a skill is a Markdown file telling the model how to do something, optionally accompanied by extra documents and pre-written scripts that the model can run to help it accomplish the tasks described by the skill. [...] At the start of a session Claude’s various harnesses can scan all available skill files and read a short explanation for each one from the frontmatter YAML in the Markdown file. This is very token efficient: each skill only takes up a few dozen extra tokens, with the full details only loaded in should the user request a task that the skill can help solve. [...] The skills mechanism is entirely dependent on the model having access to a filesystem, tools to navigate it and the ability to execute commands in that environment.	https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/16/claude-skills/

Edsger Dijkstra	Machine code, with its absence of almost any form of redundancy, was soon identified as a needlessly risky interface between man and machine. Partly in response to this recognition so-called “high-level programming languages” were developed, and, as time went by, we learned to a certain extent how to enhance the protection against silly mistakes. It was a significant improvement that now many a silly mistake did result in an error message instead of in an erroneous answer. (And even this improvement wasn't universally appreciated: some people found error messages they couldn't ignore more annoying than wrong results, and, when judging the relative merits of programming languages, some still seem to equate “the ease of programming” with the ease of making undetected mistakes.) The (abstract) machine corresponding to a programming language remained, however, a faithful slave, i.e. the nonsensible automaton perfectly capable of carrying out nonsensical instructions. Programming remained the use of a formal symbolism and, as such, continued to require the care and accuracy required before.	https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/transcriptions/EWD06xx/EWD667.html

George Marsden - The Outrageous Idea of Christian Scholarhisp	In order to avoid that “culture wars” mentality which, rather than loving one's “enemies,” vilifies them, it is important for Christian scholars also to appreciate the positive value or insight that each of the “isms” of the age exaggerates. One of the reasons for Christian scholars to be working in the mainstream academy, rather than simply denouncing “the world” and staying in their own institutions, is that they can learn from the very spirit of the age they are ultimately opposing. Even though, a la Augustine, they  may see humans as engaged in spiritual warfare, the weapons of their warfare must not be those of the earthly city.	urn:isbn: 9780197751114
George Marsden - The Outrageous Idea of Christian Scholarhisp	The central theme is that the current suspicions of Christian perspectives in the academy are reactions-often understandable---to the long establishment of Christianity in higher education. America's pace-setting universities were products of liberal Protestant culture. By “liberal Protestant” I mean a culture that took for granted Protestantism as one significant part of its heritage, but was “liberal” in that it emphasized the unifying moral dimensions of its spiritual heritage, rather than the particulars of traditional Protestant doctrine. Today's pace-setting American universities were virtually all constructed in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century by liberal Protestants.	urn:isbn: 9780197751114

Shop Class as Soulcraft	Fixing things may be a cure for narcissism.\n\nLike building houses, mathematics is constructive; every element is fully within one's view, and subject to deliberate placement. In a sense, then, a mathematical representation of the world renders the world as something of our own making. Substituting mathematical strings for shoelaces entails a bit of self-absorption, and skepticism, too: the world is interesting and intelligible only insofar as we can reproduce it in ideal form, as a projection from our selves. By contrast, in diagnosing and fixing things made by others (this other may be Volkswagen, God, or Natural Selection), one is confronted with obscurities, and must remain constantly open to the signs by which they reveal themselves. This openness is incompatible with self-absorption; to maintain it we have to fight our tendency to get anchored in snap judgments. This is easier said than done.\n\nBecause the stochastic arts diagnose and fix things that are variable, complex, and not of our own making, and therefore not fully knowable, they require a certain disposition toward the thing you are trying to fix. This disposition is at once cognitive and moral. Getting it right demands that you be attentive in the way of a conversation rather than assertive in the way of a demonstration . 7 I believe the mechanical arts have a special significance for our time because they cultivate not creativity, but the less glamorous virtue of attentiveness. Things need fixing and tending no less than creating.	urn:isbn:9780143117469
Shop Class as Soulcraft	Since the standards of craftsmanship issue from the logic of things rather than the art of persuasion, practiced submission to them perhaps gives the craftsman some psychic ground to stand on against fantastic hopes aroused by demagogues, whether commercial or political. Plato makes a distinction between technical skill and rhetoric on the grounds that rhetoric “has no account to give of the real nature of things, and so cannot tell the cause of any of them.” The craftsman's habitual deference is not toward the New, but toward the objective standards of his craft. However narrow in its application, this is a rare appearance in contemporary life--a disinterested, articu lable, and publicly affirmable idea of the good. Such a strong ontology is somewhat at odds with the cutting edge institutions of the new capitalism, and with the educational regime that aims to supply those institutions with suitable workers--pliable generalists unfettered by any single set of skills.	urn:isbn:9780143117469
Shop Class as Soulcraft	Mike Rose writes that in the practice of surgery, “dichotomies such as concrete versus abstract and technique versus reflection break down in practice. The surgeon's judgment is simultaneously technical and deliberative, and that mix is the source of its power.” This could be said of any manual skill that is diagnostic, including motorcycle repair. You come up with an imagined train of causes for manifest symptoms and judge their likelihood before tearing anything down. This imagining relies on a stock mental library, not of natural kinds or structures, like that of the surgeon, but rather the functional kinds of an internal combustion engine, their various interpretations by different manufacturers, and their proclivities for failure. You also develop a library ofsounds and smells and feels.	urn:isbn:9780143117469
Fred Brooks	The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure thought-stuff. He builds his castles in the air, from air, creating by exertion of the imagination. Few media of creation are so flexible, so easy to polish and rework, so readily capable of realizing grand conceptual structures. […] Yet the program construct, unlike the poet's words, is real in the sense that it moves and works, producing visible outputs separate from the construct itself.

After Virtue	In successfully identifying and understanding what someone else is doing we always move towards placing a particular episode in the context of a set of narrative histories, histories both of the individuals concerned and of the settings in which they act and suffer. It is now becoming clear that we render the actions of others intelligible in this way because action itself has a basically historical character. It is because we all live out narratives in our lives and because we understand our own lives in terms of the narratives that we live out that the form of narrative is appropriate for understanding the actions of others. Stories are lived before they are told--except in the case of fiction.	urn:isbn:9780268035044
After Virtue	Those various eighteenth-century writers upon the virtues who define the virtues in terms of their relationship to the passions already treat of society as nothing more than an arena in which individuals seek to secure what is useful or agreeable to them. They thus tend to exclude from view any conception of society as a community united in a shared vision of the good for man (as prior to and independent of any summing of individual interests) and a consequent shared practice of the virtues, but they do not always and entirely so exclude it.	urn:isbn:9780268035044
Richard Sennett	Every good craftsman conducts a dialogue between concrete practices and thinking; this dialogue evolves into sustaining habits, and these habits establish a rhythm between problem solving and problem finding. The relation between hand and head appears in domains seemingly as different as bricklaying, cooking, designing a playground, or playing the cello- but all these practices can misfire or fail to ripen. There is nothing inevitable about becoming skilled, just as there is nothing mindlessly mechanical about technique itself.	urn:isbn:9780300119091
Richard Sennett	Craftsmanship names an enduring, basic human impulse, the desire to do a job well for its own sake. Craftsmanship cuts a far wider swath than skilled manual labor; it serves the computer programmer, the doctor, and the artist; parenting improves when it is practiced as a skilled craft, as does citizenship. In all these domains, craftsmanship focuses on objective standards, on the thing in itself. Social and economic conditions, however, often stand in the way of the craftsman's discipline and commitment: schools may fail to provide the tools to do good work, and workplaces may not truly value the aspiration for quality. And though craftsmanship can reward an individual with a sense of pride in work, this reward is not simple. The craftsman often faces conflicting objective standards of excellence; the desire to do something well for its own sake can be impaired by competitive pressure, by frustration, or by obsession.	urn:isbn:9780300119091
Ken Bain	If you ask many academics how they define teaching, they will often talk about “transmitting” knowledge, as if teaching is telling. That’s a comforting way of thinking about it because it leaves us completely in control; if we tell them, we’ve taught them. To benefit from what the best teachers do, however, we must embrace a different model, one in which teaching occurs only when learning takes place. Most fundamentally, teaching in this conception is creating those conditions in which most—if not all—of our students will realize their potential to learn. That sounds like hard work, and it is a little scary because we don’t have complete control over who we are, but it is highly rewarding and obtainable.	urn:isbn:9780674013254
Ken Bain	While methods vary, the best teachers often try to create what we have come to call a “natural critical learning environment.” In that environment, people learn by confrontingintriguing, beautiful, or important problems, authentic tasks that will challenge them to grapple with ideas, rethink their assumptions, and examine their mental models of reality. These are challenging yet supportive conditions in which learners feel a sense of control over their education; work collaboratively with others; believe that their work will be considered fairly and honestly; and try, fail, and receive feedback from expert learners in advance of and separate from any summative judgment of their effort.	urn:isbn:9780674013254
Make It Stick	Retrieval practice—recalling facts or concepts or events from memory—is a more effective learning strategy than review by rereading. Flashcards are a simple example. Retrieval strengthens the memory and interrupts forgetting. A single, simple quiz after reading a text or hearing a lecture produces better learning and remembering than rereading the text or reviewing lecture notes. While the brain is not a muscle that gets stronger with exercise, the neural pathways that make up a body of learning do get stronger, when the memory is retrieved and the learning is practiced. Periodic practice arrests forgetting, strengthens retrieval routes, and is essential for hanging onto the knowledge you want to gain.\n\nWhen you space out practice at a task and get a little rusty between sessions, or you interleave the practice of two or more subjects, retrieval is harder and feels less productive, but the effort produces longer lasting learning and enables more versatile application of it in later settings.\n\nTrying to solve a problem before being taught the solution leads to better learning, even when errors are made in the attempt.\n\n The popular notion that you learn better when you receive instruction in a form consistent with your preferred learning style, for example as an auditory or visual learner, is not supported by the empirical research. People do have multiple forms of intelligence to bring to bear on learning, and you learn better when you “go wide,” drawing on all of your aptitudes and resourcefulness, than when you limit instruction or experience to the style you find most amenable.	urn:isbn:9780674729018
Make It Stick	People who learn to extract the key ideas from new material and organize them into a mental model and connect that model to prior knowledge show an advantage in learning complex mastery. A mental model is a mental representation of some external reality.	urn:isbn:9780674729018
Make It Stick	Learning is at least a three-step process: initial encoding of information is held in short term working memory before being consolidated into a cohesive representation of knowledge in long-term memory. Consolidation reorganizes and stabilizes memory traces, gives them meaning, and makes connections to past experiences and to other knowledge already stored in long-term memory. Retrieval updates learning and enables you to apply it when you need it.\n\nLearning always builds on a store of prior knowledge. We interpret and remember events by building connections to what we already know.\n\nLong-term memory capacity is virtually limitless: the more you know, the more possible connections you have for adding new knowledge.\n\nBecause of the vast capacity of long-term memory, having the ability to locate and recall what you know when you need it is key; your facility for calling up what you know depends on the repeated use of the information (to keep retrieval routes strong) and on your establishing powerful retrieval cues that can reactivate the memories.\n\nPeriodic retrieval of learning helps strengthen connections to the memory and the cues for recalling it, while also weakening routes to competing memories.

Within the context of schooling, motivation refers to a temporary psychic event in which curiosity is aroused and attention is focused. I do not mean to disparage it. But it must not be confused with a reason for being in a classroom, for listening to a teacher, for taking an examination, for doing homework, for putting up with school even if you are not motivated.\n\nThis kind of reason is somewhat abstract, not always present in one’s consciousness, not at all easy to describe. And yet for all that, without it schooling does not work. For school to make sense, the young, their parents, and their teachers must have a god to serve, or, even better, several gods. If they have none, school is pointless. Nietzsche’s famous aphorism is relevant here: “He who has a why to live can bear with almost any how.” This applies as much to learning as to living.\n\nTo put it simply, there is no surer way to bring an end to schooling than for it to have no end.	urn:isbn:9780679750314
Neil Postman	Without a narrative, life has no meaning. Without meaning, learning has no purpose. Without a purpose, schools are houses of detention, not attention.	urn:isbn:9780679750314
Mere Christianity	A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher. He would either be a lunatic — on the level with the man who says he is a poached egg — or else he would be the Devil of Hell. You must make your choice. Either this man was, and is, the Son of God, or else a madman or something worse.	urn:isbn:9780684823782

Kuyper	What mother loses herself in a treatise upon the “love of our children” the very moment that her own dear ones are playing about her knee, and God allows her to drink in their love with full draughts? But, in our present condition, this immediate communion with God by means of nature, and of our own heart is lost. Sin brought separation instead, and the opposition which is manifest nowadays against the authority of the HolyScriptures is based on nothing else than the false supposition that, our condition being still normal, our religion need not be soteriological. For of course, in that case, the Bible is not wanted, it becomes, indeed, a hindrance, and grates upon your feelings, since it interposes a book between God and your heart. Oral communication excludes writing. When the sun shines in your house, bright and clear, you turn off the electric light, but when the sun disappears below the horizon, you feel the necessitas luminis artificiosi, i.e., the need of artificial light, and the artificial light is kindled in every dwelling. Now this is the case in matters of religion. When there are no mists to hide the majesty of the divine light from our eyes, what need is there then for a lamp unto the feet, or a light upon the path? But when history, experience and consciousness all unite in stating the fact that the pure and full light of Heaven has disappeared, and that we are groping about in the dark, then, a different, or if you will, an artificial light must be kindled for us,-and such a light God has kindled for us in His Holy Word.	urn:isbn:9781074591311
Parker Palmer	We must enter, not evade, the tangles of teaching so we can understand them better and negotiate them with more grace, not only to guard our own spirits but also to serve our students well.\n\n    Those tangles have three important sources. The first two are commonplace, but the third, and most fundamental, is rarely given its due. First, the subjects we teach are as large and complex as life, so our knowledge of them is always flawed and partial. No matter how we devote ourselves to reading and research, teaching requires a command of content that always eludes our grasp. Second, the students we teach are larger than life and even more complex. To see them clearly and see them whole, and respond to them wisely in the moment, requires a fusion of Freud and Solomon that few of us achieve.\n\n    If students and subjects accounted for all the complexities of teaching, our standard ways of coping would do—keep up with our fields as best we can and learn enough techniques to stay ahead of the student psyche. But there is another reason for these complexities: we teach who we are.\n\n    Teaching, like any truly human activity, emerges from one’s inwardness, for better or worse. As I teach, I project the condition of my soul onto my students, my subject, and our way of being together. The entanglements I experience in the classroom are often no more or less than the convolutions of my inner life. Viewed from this angle, teaching holds a mirror to the soul. If I am willing to look in that mirror and not run from what I see, I have a chance to gain selfknowledge—and knowing myself is as crucial to good teaching as knowing my students and my subject.\n\n    In fact, knowing my students and my subject depends heavily on self-knowledge. When I do not know myself, I cannot know who my students are. I will see them through a glass darkly, in the shadows of my unexamined life—and when I cannot see them clearly, I cannot teach them well. When I do not know myself, I cannot know my subject—not at the deepest levels of embodied, personal meaning. I will know it only abstractly, from a distance, a congeries of concepts as far removed from the world as I am from personal truth.\n\n    The work required to “know thyself” is neither selfish nor narcissistic. Whatever self knowledge we attain as teachers will serve our students and our scholarship well. Good teaching requires self-knowledge: it is a secret hidden in plain sight.	urn:isbn:9781119413042
Relationship Rich Education	Learning, at its heart, is a relational process.\n\nRelationships have the power to be transformational for individuals, for our institutions, and for our world. Many of us who have the rare and special privilege to work on a college campus believe that our most important legacies are the students we influence throughout our careers. None of us can know the number of lives we touch in our work with students nor the far-reaching consequences of our words and actions.	urn:isbn:9781421439365
Relationship Rich Education	One of Vice Provost and Dean of Undergraduate Academic Affairs Ed Taylor’s responsibilities is to deliver a tone-setting address to incoming students at the sprawling University of Washington, which enrolls more than forty-five thousand students. A major theme of his address is the centrality of relationships and belonging in the undergraduate experience. “What students need and want is a sense of place and a sense of belonging: Where’s my place and who are my people? And part of that is the major—the discipline but another part of that is being in a community of people who care about you and being in relationships with faculty and others who know you.” Taylor’s office supports a range of programs, from first-year interest groups (FIGs) to high-impact practices such as undergraduate research, to help UW undergraduates “find their people.”	urn:isbn:9781421439365
Relationship Rich Education	Relationships are a flexible and adaptable approach to meeting the needs of diverse students. As Tianna Guerra, a student at Oakton Community College and an aspiring orthopedic surgeon, told us, “It only takes meeting that one great person who ignites a fire of passion within you.” The central challenge of undergraduate education is guaranteeing that every student has the powerful human interactions that ignite that fire of passion. We believe every college and university can—and must—assure just that.	urn:isbn:9781421439365
Relationship Rich Education	Human connection is the basis upon which learning takes place. Relationships are essential because there is no learning without relationships.\n\n—Randy Bass, Georgetown University\n\nRelationships are the beating heart of the undergraduate experience.\n\nWe know this to be true. The research on the significance of relationships in education is clear and long-standing. We hear that scholarship echoed in the stories alumni tell about their college days and the peers, professors, and staff who shaped their learning and their lives. Many people can recall specific faculty and staff members, peers, advisors, mentors, and coaches who profoundly influenced not only their time in college but also who they have become after graduation.	urn:isbn:9781421439365

And the dead were judged by what was written in the books, according to what they had done. And the sea gave up the dead who were in it, Death and Hades gave up the dead who were in them, and they were judged, each one of them, according to what they had done. Then Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire.

Tony Reinke	Every infection is a wake-up call allowed by God, and every scientific cure is a gracious gift from God. And yet, warns Augustine, we must wait patiently, because one day we may discover a positive use for every poison in creation. Be patient with the poisons.	urn:isbn:9781433578274
Brother Lawrence	We ought not to be weary of doing little things for the love of God, who regards not the greatness of the work, but the love with which it is performed.	urn:isbn:9781441238924

Brother Lawrence	I regard myself as the most wretched of all men, stinking and covered with sores, and as one who has committed all sorts of crimes against his King. Overcome by remorse, I confess all my wickedness to Him, ask His pardon and abandon myself entirely to Him to do with as He will. But this King, filled with goodness and mercy, far from chastising me, lovingly embraces me, makes me eat at His table, serves me with His own hands, gives me the keys of His treasures and treats me as His favorite. He talks with me and is delighted with me in a thousand and one ways; He forgives me and relieves me of my principle bad habits without talking about them; I beg Him to make me according to His heart and always the more weak and despicable I see myself to be, the more beloved I am of God.	urn:isbn:9781441238924
Non-violent Communication	We are dangerous when we are not conscious of our responsibility for how we behave, think, and feel.	urn:isbn:9781892005038
Non-violent Communication	all criticism, attack, insults, and judgments vanish when we focus attention on hearing the feelings and needs behind a message. The more we practice in this way, the more we realize a simple truth: behind all those messages we’ve allowed ourselves to be intimidated by are just individuals with unmet needs appealing to us to contribute to their well-being. When we receive messages with this awareness, we never feel dehumanized by what others have to say to us. We only feel dehumanized when we get trapped in derogatory images of other people or thoughts of wrongness about ourselves.	urn:isbn:9781892005038
Non-violent Communication	Two questions help us see why we are unlikely to get what we want by using punishment to change people’s behavior. The first question is: What do I want this person to do that’s different from what he or she is currently doing? If we ask only this first question, punishment may seem effective, because the threat or exercise of punitive force may well influence someone’s behavior. However, with the second question, it becomes evident that punishment isn’t likely to work: What do I want this person’s reasons to be for doing what I’m asking?	urn:isbn:9781892005038
Non-violent Communication	In this stage, which I refer to as emotional slavery, we believe ourselves responsible for the feelings of others. We think we must constantly strive to keep everyone happy. If they don’t appear happy, we feel responsible and compelled to do something about it. This can easily lead us to see the very people who are closest to us as burdens.	urn:isbn:9781892005038
