description: Apply this skill generate reflection questions

Refection questions should focus on the upper levels of Bloom's revised taxonomy (apply, analyze, evaluate, and create) while having less focus on the lower levels (remember and understand).

Questions should be no more than 30 words. Appropriate responses should be no more than a paragraphs or two. The questions should encourage deep thought, but not require a long essay to properly respond.

If the provided context includes code, reflection questions may include coding tasks, but some should still be natural language reflection without code.
